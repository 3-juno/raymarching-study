# WEBGL TUTORIAL WITH THREE.JS

This source code is for the WebGL tutorial series.
This tutorial articles are in preparation. (I'm not good at English so it takes some time, so I'll publish Japanese articles first)

This tutorial series will be for front-end developer who wants to start three.js and use it for their own projects in the future. 
I won't talk about how to use three.js. I want to share how WebGL works on GPU side, and how to draw something special with three.js as easy as possible.

I use always shaders (vertex shader & fragment shader), and I'll explain how to use it and how it works at the first tutorial.
Then I'll explain how to draw 3D pictures with matrices and the role of camera at second tutorial. And at third tutorial I'll do how to calculate lighting with dot products. After that I have no idea, maybe I'll do how to draw multiple many objects. And I want to do distance fog, offscreen rendering!
